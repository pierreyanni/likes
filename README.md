There are 3 types of notebooks (each of them can be run separately):
* data exploration,
* 4 individual models: ridge with 2nd degree polynomials, random forest, gradient boosting and support vector regression,
* a stacking model that takes the 4 individual models as inputs.

Older notebooks and those not used for the best submissions are in the directory *old_notebooks*.
